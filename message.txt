      "The participation of women and girls in sports physical fitness and exercise has existed throughout history However participation rates and activities vary in accordance with nation era geography and stage of economic development The modern era of organized sports did not begin to emerge either for women or men until the late industrial ageUntil roughly 1870 womens activities tended to be informal and recreational in nature lacked rules codes and emphasized physical activity rather than competition Today womens sports are more sportspecific and have developed into both amateur levels and professional levels in various places internationally but is found primarily within developed countries where conscious organization and accumulation of wealth has occurred In the midtolatter part of the 20th century female participation in sport and the popularization of their involvement increased particularly during its last quarter Very few organized sports have been invented by women Sports such as Newcomb ball netball acrobatic gymnastics and tumbling and possibly stoolball are examplesWomens involvement in sports is more visible in welldeveloped countries and today their level of participation and performance still varies greatly by country and by sport Despite an increase in womens participation in sport the male demographic is still the larger of the two These demographic differences are observed globally Female dominated sports are the one exception Girls participation in sports tend to be higher in the United States than in other parts of the world like Western Europe and Latin America Girls participation in more violent contact sports is far less than that of their male counterpartsTwo important divisions exist in relation to female sporting categories These sports either emerged exclusively as an organized female sport with male exclusion or were developed as an organized female variant of a sport first popularized by a male demographic and therefore became a female category In all but a few exceptional cases such as in the case of camogie a female variant or womens game uses the same name of the sport popularly played by men but is classified into a different category which is differentiated by sex mens or womens or girls or boys Female variants are widely common while organized female sports by comparison are rare and include team sports such as netball throwball artistic ne synchronized swimming and ringette In female sports the supposed benefits of gender parity gender equity and sex segregation are controversialExcept in a few rare cases like womens professional tennis professional womens sport rarely provide competitors with a livable income In addition competing for media coverage of the womens variant of a sport which is primarily popular among males creates complex barriers More recently there has been an increasing amount of interest research investment and production in regards to equipment design for female athletes Interest and research involving the identification of sexspecific injuries particularly though not exclusively among high performance female athletes has increased as well such as in the case of concussions and the female athlete triad aka Relative energy deficiency in sport REDSAt times female athletes have engaged in social activism in conjunction with their participation in sport Protest methods have included playing strikes social media campaigns and in the case of America federal lawsuits on grounds of inequality usually as it relates to gender parity principles American law and Title IX which demand schools that any funds given to support students sports should be equally distributed between boys and girls Public service oriented promotional campaigns for girls in sport involve a variety of media campaign styles",

      "Nudity",
      "Nudity is the state of being in which a human is without clothing While estimates vary for the first 90000 years of prehistory anatomically modern humans were naked having lost their body hair and living in hospitable climates As humans became behaviorally modern body adornments such as jewelry tattoos body paint and scarification became part of nonverbal communications indicating a persons social and individual characteristics Indigenous peoples in warm climates used clothing for decorative symbolic or ceremonial purposes but were often nude having neither the need to protect the body from the elements nor any conception of nakedness being shameful In many societies both ancient and contemporary children might be naked until the beginning of puberty Women may not cover their breasts if they were associated with nursing babies more than with sexualityIn the ancient civilizations of the Mediterranean from Mesopotamia to the Roman Empire proper attire was required to maintain social standing The lower classes might possess a single piece of cloth that was wrapped or tied to cover the lower body the lowest classes including slaves might be naked However through much of Western history until the modern era people of any status were also unclothed by necessity or convenience when engaged in labor and athletics or when bathing or swimming Such functional nudity occurred in groups that were usually but not always segregated by sex Although improper dress might be socially embarrassing the association of nudity with sin regarding sexuality began with JudeoChristian societies spreading through Europe in the postclassical period Traditional clothing in temperate regions worldwide also reflect concerns for maintaining social status and order as well as by necessity due to the colder climate However societies such as Japan and Finland maintain traditions of communal nudity based upon the use of baths and saunas that provided alternatives to sexualizationThe spread of Western concepts of modest dress was part of colonialism and continues today with globalization Contemporary social norms regarding nudity reflect cultural ambiguity towards the body and sexuality and differing conceptions of what constitutes public versus private spaces Norms relating to nudity are different for men than they are for women Individuals may intentionally violate norms relating to nudity those without power may use nudity as a form of protest and those with power may impose nakedness on others as a form of punishmentWhile the majority of contemporary societies require clothing in public some recognize nonsexual nudity as being appropriate for some recreational social or celebratory activities and appreciate nudity in the arts as representing positive values A minority within many countries assert the benefits of social nudity while other groups continue to disapprove of nudity not only in public but also in private based upon religious beliefs Norms are codified to varying degrees by laws defining proper dress and indecent exposure",

      "Insects from Latin insectum are hexapod invertebrates of the class Insecta They are the largest group within the arthropod phylum Insects have a chitinous exoskeleton a threepart body head thorax and abdomen three pairs of jointed legs compound eyes and a pair of antennae Insects are the most diverse group of animals with more than a million described species they represent more than half of all animal species The insect nervous system consists of a brain and a ventral nerve cord Most insects reproduce by laying eggs Insects breathe air through a system of paired openings along their sides connected to small tubes that take air directly to the tissues The blood therefore does not carry oxygen it is only partly contained in vessels and some circulates in an open hemocoel Insect vision is mainly through their compound eyes with additional small ocelli Many insects can hear using tympanal organs which may be on the legs or other parts of the body Their sense of smell is via receptors usually on the antennae and the mouthparts Nearly all insects hatch from eggs Insect growth is constrained by the inelastic exoskeleton so development involves a series of molts The immature stages often differ from the adults in structure habit and habitat Groups that undergo fourstage metamorphosis often have a nearly immobile pupa Insects that undergo threestage metamorphosis lack a pupa developing through a series of increasingly adultlike nymphal stages The higher level relationship of the insects is unclear Fossilized insects of enormous size have been found from the Paleozoic Era including giant dragonflylike insects with wingspans of 55 to 70 cm 22 to 28 in The most diverse insect groups appear to have coevolved with flowering plantsAdult insects typically move about by walking and flying some can swim Insects are the only invertebrates that can achieve sustained powered flight insect flight evolved just once Many insects are at least partly aquatic and have larvae with gills in some species the adults too are aquatic Some species such as water striders can walk on the surface of water Insects are mostly solitary but some such as bees ants and termites are social and live in large wellorganized colonies Others such as earwigs provide maternal care guarding their eggs and young Insects can communicate with each other in a variety of ways Male moths can sense the pheromones of female moths over great distances Other species communicate with sounds crickets stridulate or rub their wings together to attract a mate and repel other males Lampyrid beetles communicate with lightHumans regard many insects as pests especially those that damage crops and attempt to control them using insecticides and other techniques Others are parasitic and may act as vectors of diseases Insect pollinators are essential to the reproduction of many flowering plants and so to their ecosystems Many insects are ecologically beneficial as predators of pest insects while a few provide direct economic benefit Two species in particular are economically important and were domesticated many centuries ago silkworms for silk and honey bees for honey Insects are consumed as food in 80 of the worlds nations by people in roughly 3000 ethnic groups Human activities are having serious effects on insect biodiversity",
