It was the last great pandemic of the 19th century, and is among the deadliest pandemics in history. The pandemic killed about 1 million people out of a world population of about 1.5 billion (0.067% of population). The most reported effects of the pandemic took place from October 1889 to December 1890, with recurrences in March to June 1891, November 1891 to June 1892, the northern winter of 1893–1894, and early 1895.\\nAccording to researchers\\' estimates, excess mortality from Russian influenza in the Russian Empire for the period 1889–1890 could be from 60,000 to 90,000 people, with lethality from the virus, a little more than 0.2%.\\nAlthough contemporaries described the pandemic as influenza and 20th-century scholars identified several influenza strains as the possible pathogen, several authors from the early 2020s suggest that it may have been caused by human coronavirus OC43.\\n\\n'"

saliva mucus and feces of infected birds other infected animals may shed bird flu viruses in respiratory secretions and other body fluids such as milk The virus can spread rapidly through poultry flocks and among wild birds An estimated half a billion farmed birds have been slaughtered in efforts to contain the virusSymptoms of AH5N1 influenza vary according to both the strain of virus underlying the infection and on the species of bird or mammal affected Classification as either Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza LPAI or High Pathogenic Avian Influenza HPAI is based on the severity of symptoms in domestic chickens and does not predict the severity of symptoms in other species Chickens infected with LPAI AH5N1 virus display mild symptoms or are asymptomatic whereas HPAI AH5N1 causes serious breathing difficulties a significant drop in egg production and sudden deathIn mammals including humans AH5N1 influenza whether LPAI or HPAI is rare Symptoms of infection vary from mild to severe including fever diarrhoea and cough Human infections with AH5N1 virus have been reported in 23 countries since 1997 resulting in severe pneumonia and death in about 50 of cases Between 2003 and August 2024 the World Health Organization has recorded  907 cases of confirmed H5N1 influenza leading to 464 deaths The true fatality rate may be lower because some cases with mild symptoms may not have been identified as H5N1AH5N1 influenza virus was first identified in farmed birds in southern China in 1996 Between 1996 and 2018 AH5N1 coexisted in bird populations with other subtypes of the virus but since then the highly pathogenic subtype HPAI AH5N1 has become the dominant strain in bird populations worldwide Some strains of AH5N1 which are highly pathogenic to chickens have adapted to cause mild symptoms in ducks and geese and are able to spread rapidly through bird migration Mammal species that have been recorded with H5N1 infection include cows seals goats and skunksDue to the

1900 with each of the two main tickets receiving more than 74 million votes surpassing Barack Obamas record of 695 million votes from 2008 Biden received more than 81 million votes the most votes ever

an underestimate of prevalence in low and middleincome countriesASD averages a 431 maletofemale ratio in diagnosis not accounting for ASD in gender diverse populations which overlap disproportionately with ASD populations The number of children known to have autism has increased dramatically since the 1980s at least partly due to changes in diagnostic practice it is unclear whether prevalence has actually increased and asyetunidentified environmental risk factors cannot be ruled out In 2020 the Centers for Disease Controls Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring ADDM Network reported that approximately 1 in 54 children in the United States 1 in 34 boys and 1 in 144 girls are diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder ASD based on data collected in 2016 This estimate is a 10 increase from the 1 in 59 rate in 2014 105 increase from the 1 in 110 rate in 2006 and 176 increase from the 1 in 150 rate in 2000 Diagnostic criteria of ASD has changed significantly since the 1980s for example US specialeducation autism classification was introduced in 1994ASD is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder and although what causes it is still not entirely known efforts have been made to outline causative mechanisms and how they give rise to the disorder The risk of developing autism is increased in the presence of various prenatal factors including advanced paternal age and diabetes in the mother during pregnancy In rare cases autism is strongly associated with agents that cause birth defects It has been shown to be related to genetic disorders and with epilepsy ASD is believed to be largely inherited although the genetics of ASD are complex and it is unclear which genes are responsible ASD is also associated with several intellectual or emotional gifts which has led to a variety of hypotheses from within evolutionary psychiatry that autistic traits have played a beneficial role over human evolutionary historyOther proposed causes of autism have been controversial The vaccine hypothesis has been extensively investigated and shown to be false lacking any scientific evidence Andrew Wakefield published a small study in 1998 in the United Kingdom suggesting a causal link between autism and the trivalent MMR vaccine After data included in the report was shown to be deliberately falsified the paper was retracted and Wakefield was struck off the medical register in the United KingdomIt is problematic to compare autism rates over the last three decades as the diagnostic criteria for autism have changed with each revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual DSM which outlines which symptoms meet the criteria for an ASD diagnosis In 1983 the DSM did not recognize PDDNOS or Aspergers syndrome and the criteria for autistic disorder AD were more restrictive The previous edition of the DSM DSMIV included autistic disorder childhood disintegrative disorder PDDNOS and Aspergers syndrome Due to inconsistencies in diagnosis and how much is still being learnt about autism the most recent DSM DSM5 only has one diagnosis autism spectrum disorder ASD which encompasses each of the previous four disorders According to the new diagnostic criteria for ASD one must have both struggles  in social communication and interaction and restricted repetitive behaviors interests and activities RRBsASD diagnoses continue to be over four times

thiomersal vaccine controversy centers around public concerns and debates over the safety of thiomersal a mercurybased preservative used in vaccines with some fearing it could cause neurological disorders such as autism despite extensive scientific research showing no credible evidence linking thiomersal to such conditionsThiomersal or thimerosal is a mercury compound which is used as a preservative in some vaccines Antivaccination activists promoting the incorrect claim that vaccination causes autism have asserted that the mercury in thiomersal is the cause There is no scientific evidence to support this claim The idea that thiomersal in vaccines might have detrimental effects originated with antivaccination activists and was sustained by them and especially through the action of plaintiffs lawyersThe potential impact of thiomersal on autism has been investigated extensively Multiple lines of scientific evidence have shown that thiomersal does not cause autism For example the clinical symptoms of mercury poisoning differ significantly from those of autism In addition multiple population studies have found no association between thiomersal and autism and rates of autism have continued to increase despite removal of thiomersal from vaccines Thus major scientific and medical bodies such as the Institute of Medicine and World Health Organization WHO as well as governmental agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC reject any role for thiomersal in autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders In spite of the consensus of the scientific community some parents and advocacy groups continue to contend that thiomersal is linked to autism and the claim is still stated as if it were fact in antivaccination propaganda notably that of Robert F Kennedy Jr through his group Childrens Health Defense Thiomersal is no longer used in most childrens vaccines in the United States with the exception of some types of flu shots While exposure to mercury may result in damage to brain kidneys and developing fetus the scientific consensus is that thiomersal has no such effectsThis controversy has caused harm due to parents attempting to treat their autistic children with unproven and possibly dangerous treatments discouraging parents from vaccinating their children due to fears about thiomersal toxicity and diverting resources away from research into more promising areas for the cause of autism Thousands of lawsuits have been filed in the US to seek damages from alleged toxicity from vaccines including those purportedly caused by thiomersal US courts have ruled against multiple representative test cases involving thiomersal A 2011 journal article described the vaccineautism connection as perhaps the most damaging medical hoax of the last 100 years', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiomersal_and_vaccines', 'topic': 'Health'}, {'revision_id':

existed about the structure and function of coronaviruses causing diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome MERS This knowledge accelerated the development of various vaccine platforms in early 2020 The initial focus of SARSCoV2 vaccines was on preventing symptomatic often severe illness In 2020 the first COVID19 vaccines were developed and made available to the public through emergency authorizations and conditional approvals Initially most COVID19 vaccines were twodose vaccines with the exception singledose vaccines Convidecia and the Janssen COVID19 vaccine and vaccines with threedose schedules Razi Cov Pars and Soberana However immunity from the vaccines has been found to wane over time requiring people to get booster doses of the vaccine to maintain protection against COVID19The COVID19 vaccines are widely credited for their role in reducing the spread of COVID19 and reducing the severity and death caused by COVID19

theory', 'summary': 'The COVID19 lab leak theory or lab leak hypothesis is the idea that SARSCoV2 the virus that caused the COVID19 pandemic came from a laboratory This claim is highly controversial most scientists believe the virus spilled into human populations through natural zoonosis transfer directly from an infected nonhuman animal similar to the SARSCoV1 and MERSCoV outbreaks and consistent with other pandemics in human history Available evidence suggests that the SARSCoV2 virus was originally harbored by bats and spread to humans from infected wild animals functioning as an intermediate host at the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan Hubei China in December 2019 Several candidate animal species have been identified as potential intermediate hosts There is no evidence SARSCoV2 existed in any laboratory prior to the pandemic or that any suspicious biosecurity incidents happened in any laboratoryMany scenarios proposed for a lab leak are characteristic of conspiracy theories Central to many is the misplaced suspicion about the proximity of the outbreak to a virology institute that studies coronaviruses the Wuhan Institute of Virology WIV Most large Chinese cities have laboratories that study coronaviruses and virus outbreaks typically begin in rural areas but are first noticed in large cities If a coronavirus outbreak occurs in China there is a high likelihood it will occur near a large city and therefore near a laboratory studying coronaviruses The idea of a leak at the WIV also gained support due to secrecy during the Chinese governments response The lab leak theory and its weaponization by politicians have both leveraged and increased antiChinese racism Scientists from WIV had previously collected virus samples from bats in the wild and allegations that they also performed undisclosed work on such viruses are central to some versions of the idea Some versions particularly those alleging genome engineering are based on misinformation or misrepresentations of scientific evidenceThe idea that the virus was released from a laboratory accidentally or deliberately appeared early in the pandemic It gained popularity in the United States through promotion by conservative personalities in early 2020 fomenting tensions between the US and China Scientists and media outlets widely dismissed it as a conspiracy theory The accidental leak idea had a resurgence in 2021 In March the World Health Organization WHO published a report which deemed the possibility extremely unlikely though the WHOs directorgeneral said the reports conclusions were not definitive Subsequent plans for laboratory audits were rejected by ChinaMost scientists remain skeptical of the possibility of a laboratory origin citing a lack of any supporting evidence for a lab leak and the abundant evidence supporting zoonosis Though some scientists agree a lab leak should be examined as part of ongoing investigations politicization remains a concern In July 2022 two papers published in Science described novel epidemiological and genetic evidence that suggested the pandemic likely began at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and did not come from a laboratory',

communication speech and repetitive sensorymotor behaviors The 11th International Classification of Diseases ICD11 released in January 2021 characterizes ASD by the associated deficits in the ability to initiate and sustain twoway social communication and restricted or repetitive behavior unusual for the individuals age or situation Although linked with early childhood the symptoms can appear later as well Symptoms can be detected before the age of two and experienced practitioners can give a reliable diagnosis by that age However official diagnosis may not occur until much older even well into adulthood There is a large degree of variation in how much support a person with ASD needs in daytoday life This can be classified by a further diagnosis of ASD level 1 level 2 or level 3 Of these ASD level 3 describes people requiring very substantial support and who experience more severe symptoms ASDrelated deficits in nonverbal and verbal social skills can result in impediments in personal family social educational and occupational situations This disorder tends to have a strong correlation with genetics along with other factors More research is identifying ways in which epigenetics is linked to autism Epigenetics generally refers to the ways in which chromatin structure is altered to affect gene expression Mechanisms such as cytosine regulation and posttranslational modifications of histones Of the 215 genes contributing to some extent in ASD 42 have been found to be involved in epigenetic modification of gene expression Some examples of ASD signs are specific or repeated behaviors enhanced sensitivity to materials being upset by changes in routine appearing to show reduced interest in others avoiding eye contact and limitations in social situations as well as verbal communication When social interaction becomes more important some whose condition might have been overlooked suffer social and other exclusion and are more likely to have coexisting mental and physical conditions Longterm problems include difficulties in daily living such as managing schedules hypersensitivities eg to foods noises fabric textures light initiating and sustaining relationships and maintaining jobsDiagnosis is based on observation of behavior and development Many especially girls and those who have fewer social difficulties may have been misdiagnosed with other conditions Males are diagnosed with ASD four to five times more often than females The reasons for this remain predominantly unclear but current hypotheses include a higher testosterone level in utero different presentations of symptoms in females leading to misdiagnosis or underdiagnosis compared to males and gender bias Clinical assessment of children can involve a variety of individuals including the caregivers the child and a core team of professionals pediatricians child psychiatrists speechandlanguage therapists and clinicaleducational psychologists For adult diagnosis clinicians identify neurodevelopmental history behaviors difficulties in communication limited interests and problems in education employment and social relationships Challenging behaviors may be assessed with functional analysis to identify the triggers causing them The sex and gender disparity in ASD diagnostics requires further research in terms of adding diagnosis specifiers as well as femaleoriented examples which may be masked through camouflaging behaviors Camouflaging is defined as a coping mechanism used in social situations consisting of individuals pretending to be other people without any communication difficulties Because of camouflaging and other societal factors females with ASD are more likely to be diagnosed late or with a different mental health concern In general it is critical for people to understand that the female ASD phenotype is less noticeable especially when they present as higher functioning than others with ASD Lastly due to the imbalance in sexes participating in ASD studies the  literature is potentially biased towards the ways that it presents in male individualsASD is considered a lifelong condition and has no cure Many professionals advocates and people in the autistic community agree that a cure is not the answer and efforts should instead focus on methods to help people with ASD have happier healthier and if possible independent lives Support efforts include teaching social and behavioral skills monitoring factoringin coexisting conditions and guidance for the caregivers family educators and employers There is no specific medication for ASD however drugs can be prescribed for other coexisting mental health conditions such as anxiety A study in 2019 found that the management of challenging behaviors was generally of low quality with little support for longterm usage of psychotropic drugs and concerns about their inappropriate prescription Genetic research has improved the understanding of ASDrelated molecular pathways Animal

have a strong genetic component with studies consistently demonstrating a higher prevalence among siblings and in families with a history of autism This led researchers to investigate the extent to which genetics contribute to the development of autism Numerous studies including twin studies and family studies have estimated the heritability of autism to be around 80 to 90 indicating that genetic factors play a substantial role in its etiology Heritability estimates do not imply that autism is solely determined by genetics as environmental factors also contribute to the development of the disorderStudies of twins from 1977 to 1995 estimated the heritability of autism to be more than 90 in other words that 90 of the differences between autistic and nonautistic individuals are due to genetic effects When only one identical twin is autistic the other often has learning or social disabilities For adult siblings the likelihood of having one or more features of the broad autism phenotype might be as high as 30 much higher than the likelihood in controlsThough genetic linkage analysis have been inconclusive many association analyses have discovered genetic variants associated with autism For each autistic individual mutations in many genes are typically implicated Mutations in different sets of genes may be involved in different autistic individuals There may be significant interactions among mutations in several genes or between the environment and mutated genes By identifying genetic markers inherited with autism in family studies numerous candidate genes have been located most of which encode proteins involved in neural development and function However for most of the candidate genes the actual mutations that increase the likelihood for autism have not been identified Typically autism cannot be traced to a Mendelian singlegene mutation or to single chromosome abnormalities such as fragile X syndrome or 22q13 deletion syndrome1015 of autism cases may result from single gene disorders or copy number variations CNVsspontaneous alterations in the genetic material during meiosis that delete or duplicate genetic material These sometimes result in syndromic autism as opposed to the more common idiopathic autism Sporadic noninherited cases have been examined to identify candidate genetic loci involved in autism A substantial fraction of autism may be highly heritable but not inherited that is the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genomeAlthough the fraction of autism traceable to a genetic cause may grow to 3040 as the resolution of array comparative genomic hybridization CGH improves several results in this area have been described incautiously possibly misleading the public into thinking that a large proportion of autism is caused by CNVs and is detectable via array CGH or that detecting CNVs is tantamount to a genetic diagnosis The Autism Genome Project database contains genetic linkage and CNV

transmitted when people breathe in air contaminated by dropletsaerosols and small airborne particles containing the virus Infected people exhale those particles as they breathe talk cough sneeze or sing Transmission is more likely the closer people are However infection can occur over longer distances particularly indoorsThe transmission of the virus is carried out through virusladen fluid particles or droplets which are created in the respiratory tract and they are expelled by the mouth and the nose There are three types of transmission droplet and contact which are associated with large droplets and airborne which is associated with small droplets If the droplets are above a certain critical size they settle faster than they evaporate and therefore they contaminate surfaces surrounding them Droplets that are below a certain critical size generally thought to be 100μm diameter evaporate faster than they settle due to that fact they form respiratory aerosol particles that remain airborne for a long period of time over extensive distancesInfectivity can begin four to five days before the onset of symptoms Infected people can spread the disease even if they are presymptomatic or asymptomatic  Most commonly the peak viral load in upper respiratory tract samples occurs close to the time of symptom onset and declines after the first week after symptoms begin Current evidence suggests a duration of viral shedding and the period of infectiousness of up to ten days following symptom onset for people with mild to moderate COVID19 and up to 20 days for persons with severe COVID19 including immunocompromised peopleInfectious particles range in size from aerosols that remain suspended in the air for long periods of time to larger droplets that remain airborne briefly or fall to the ground Additionally COVID19 research has redefined the traditional understanding of how respiratory viruses are transmitted The largest droplets of respiratory fluid do not travel far but can be inhaled or land on mucous membranes on the eyes nose or mouth to infect Aerosols are highest in concentration when people are in close proximity which leads to easier viral transmission when people are physically close but airborne transmission can occur at longer distances mainly in locations that are poorly ventilated in those conditions small particles can remain suspended in the air for minutes to hoursThe number of people generally infected by one infected person varies  but it is estimated that the R0 R nought or R zero number is around 25 The disease often spreads in clusters where infections can be traced back to an index case or geographical location Often in these instances superspreading events occur where many people are infected by one personA person can get COVID19 indirectly by touching a contaminated surface or object before touching their own mouth nose or eyes though strong evidence suggests this does not contribute substantially to new infections Transmission from human to animal is possible as in the first case but the probability of a human contracting the disease from an animal is considered very low Although it is considered possible there is no direct evidence of the virus being transmitted by skin to skin contact Transmission through feces and wastewater have also been identified as possible The virus is not known to

differences in autism exist regarding prevalence presentation and diagnosisMen and boys are more frequently diagnosed with autism than women and girls It is debated whether this is due to a sex difference in rates of autism spectrum disorders ASD or whether females are underdiagnosed The prevalence ratio is often cited as about 4 males for every 1 female diagnosed Other research indicates that it is closer to 31 or 21 One in every 42 males and one in 189 females in the United States is diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder There is some evidence that females may also receive diagnoses somewhat later than males however thus far results have been contradictorySeveral theories exist to explain the sexbased discrepancy such as a genetic protective effect the extreme male brain theory and phenotypic differences in the presentation between sexes which may all be intertwined Researchers have also debated whether a diagnostic gender bias has played a role in females being underdiagnosed with autism spectrum disorder Researchers have also speculated a gender bias in parental reporting due to the expectations and socialization of gender roles in societySince autism is a largely genetic and hereditary condition genetic factors that lead to differences depending on sex come into play such as the role of androgen signaling in male development or Xlinked mutations whose associated genetic conditions are typically more common and severe in males The extreme male brain theory suggests that autistic brains show an exaggeration of the features associated with male brains such as increased size and decreased relative connectivity as well as systematic thinking over empathetic thinking The imprinted brain hypothesis suggests genomic imprinting is at least partly responsible for the sex differences in autism and points to the evidence for a common genetic cause with schizophreniaCompared to men women are generally required to be more impaired by their autism or have more cognitive or behavioral conditions than their male counterparts to meet autism spectrum criteria There is evidence of increased incidence of social anxiety anorexia nervosa and selfharm in autistic females though the increased rates of anorexia nervosa and other eating disorders may be due to confusion or conflation with avoidantrestrictive food intake disorder ARFID which is particularly common in autismSome studies have found that autistic girls and women show higher social motivation and a greater capacity for typical friendships than autistic boys and men Other studies have found that females are more likely to avoid social contact while males are more likely to attempt social contact while remaining unaware of their social deficits Similar to the female phenotype of ADHD research has shown that women with autism are less likely to be hyperactive impulsive have issues with conduct or stereotyped behavioral traits and have been shown to mask their autistic behaviors and social difficulties more frequently than autistic men Autistic males often exhibit more easily observed behaviors at a younger age resulting in parental observance and subsequent evaluation of the child In contrast behavior of young females is more often overlooked regardless of any associated atrisk factors for ASD or other developmental delays Ultimately this may contribute to females more frequently receiving their ASD diagnosis later in life than their male counterpart There is a growing consensus among neuroscientists that the number of autistic women has been vastly underrepresented due to the assumption that it is primarily a male condition', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_and_gender_differences_in_autism', 'topic': 'Health'}, {'revision_id':

bacterium Yersinia pestis and spread by fleas and through the air One of the most significant events in European history the Black Death had farreaching population economic and cultural impacts It was the beginning of the second plague pandemic The plague created religious social and economic upheavals with profound effects on the course of European historyThe origin of the Black Death is disputed Genetic analysis suggests Yersinia pestis bacteria evolved approximately 7000 years ago at the beginning of the Neolithic with fleamediated strains emerging around 3800 years ago during the late Bronze Age The immediate territorial origins of the Black Death and its outbreak remain unclear with some evidence pointing towards Central Asia China the Middle East and Europe The pandemic was reportedly first introduced to Europe during the siege of the Genoese trading port of Kaffa in Crimea by the Golden Horde army of Jani Beg in 1347 From Crimea it was most likely carried by fleas living on the black rats that travelled on Genoese ships spreading through the Mediterranean Basin and reaching North Africa West Asia and the rest of Europe via Constantinople Sicily and the Italian Peninsula There is evidence that once it came ashore the Black Death mainly spread from persontoperson as pneumonic plague thus explaining the quick inland spread of the epidemic which was faster than would be expected if the primary vector was rat fleas causing bubonic plague In 2022 it was discovered that there was a sudden surge of deaths in what is today Kyrgyzstan from the Black Death in the late 1330s when combined with genetic evidence this implies that the initial spread may not have been due to Mongol conquests in the 14th century as previously speculatedThe Black Death was the second great natural disaster to strike Europe during the Late Middle Ages the first one being the Great Famine of 13151317 and is estimated to have killed 30 to 60 of the European population as well as approximately 33 of the population of the Middle East There were further outbreaks throughout the Late Middle Ages and also due to other contributing factors the Crisis of the Late Middle Ages the

merged with other conditions into autism spectrum disorder ASD and is no longer considered a diagnosis It was considered milder than other diagnoses which were merged into ASD due to relatively unimpaired spoken language and intelligenceThe syndrome was named after the Austrian pediatrician Hans Asperger who in 1944 described children in his care who struggled to form friendships did not understand others gestures or feelings engaged in onesided conversations about their favorite interests and were clumsy In 1994 the diagnosis of Asperger syndrome was included in the fourth edition DSMIV of the American Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders however with the publication of DSM5 in 2013 the syndrome was removed and the symptoms are now included within autism spectrum disorder along with classic autism and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified PDDNOS It was similarly merged into autism spectrum disorder in the International Classification of Diseases ICD11 as of 2021The exact cause of Asperger syndrome is not well understood While it has high heritability the underlying genetics have not been determined conclusively Environmental factors are also believed to play a role Brain imaging has not identified a common underlying condition There is no single treatment and the UKs National Health Service NHS guidelines suggest that treatment of any form of autism should not be a goal since autism is not a disease that can be removed or cured According to the Royal College of Psychiatrists while cooccurring conditions might require treatment management of autism itself is chiefly about the provision of the education training and social supportcare required to improve the persons ability to function in the everyday world The effectiveness of particular interventions for autism is supported by only limited data Interventions may include social skills training cognitive behavioral therapy physical therapy speech therapy parent training and medications for associated problems such as mood or anxiety Autistic characteristics tend to become less obvious in adulthood but social and communication difficulties usually persistIn 2015 Asperger syndrome was estimated to affect 372 million people globally or about 05 of the population The exact percentage of people affected has still not been firmly established Autism spectrum disorder is diagnosed in males more often than females and females are typically diagnosed at a later age The modern conception of Asperger syndrome came into

intermediate success that had been achieved in the fight against the pandemic The same day a first loosening of restrictions was announced continued in early May and eventually holiday travels were allowed in cooperation with other European countries A number of state premiers pressed for faster relaxation of restrictions putting them at odds with Merkel who favoured a more cautious approach a pattern that repeated itself later that year Substantial local outbreaks in meat processing plants drew public attention beyond the epidemiological context to poor working conditions By late August infection numbers had returned to the levels of April and a possible second wave of the pandemic was under debate By mid October it was believed by experts to be inevitable A partial lockdown from 2 November only temporarily halted the rise in case numbers the total number of reported infections since the start of the pandemic crossed one million on 27 November A hard lockdown from 15 December made FFP2 masks or other clinical masks mandatory on public transport and in shops Repeated lockdown extensions were mainly motivated by the appearance of the Alpha variant and other mutations Death rates in nursing homes remained high until late January 2021 but dropped strongly in February likely due to residents and workers at these facilities having been prioritised in the vaccination campaign The second wave peaked in JanuaryIn March 2021 the Alpha variant drove a third wave of infections The average age of the infected as well as of those requiring intensive care was much younger than in the first two waves A reform of the Infection Protection Act in late April increased federal government powers allowing it to mandate pandemic measures in hardhit districts in November 2021 the measures were ruled by the Federal Constitutional Court to have been legal From late April infection numbers started to continuously decrease the third wave was seen as broken by early May The

infections set a new record since the beginning of the pandemic Health Minister Jens Spahn spoke of a massive pandemic of the unvaccinated which was criticized by scientists for underrating the role of the vaccinated in the pandemic Unprecedentedly high infection numbers led Germany to reintroduce free coronavirus testing in November a month after they had been phased out and to launch a booster

trust local government officials state government officials the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony FauciTrump was publicly optimistic through much of the pandemic at times his optimistic messaging diverged from that of his administrations public health officials From January to midMarch 2020 Trump downplayed the threat posed by COVID19 to the United States as well as the severity of the outbreak Trump did however place restrictions on travel from China on January 31 From February to May Trump continually asserted that COVID19 would go away The CDC waited until February 25 to first warn the American public to prepare for a local outbreak of the virus In March 2020 the administration began conducting daily press briefings at the White House where Trump was the dominant speaker Trump repeatedly made false statements regarding the pandemic He took messaging advice from Fox News hosts like Sean Hannity and Lou Dobbs both of whom he dialed into Oval Office meetings Trump exaggerated the impact of measures taken by his government and the private sector understated the projected time to produce a vaccine recommended uncontrolled transmission in pursuit of herd immunity until a vaccine was developed and promoted unapproved treatments such as hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine In such instances scientists including Anthony Fauci Michael Osterholm and Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus directorgeneral of the World Health Organization publicly countered his message with correct information Trump also frequently reversed his stances in his communication leading to mixed or contradictory messaging He sometimes denied his own public statementsTrump repeatedly blamed others for the severity of the outbreak The most frequent targets of his criticism were Democrats followed by the media state governors and China where the virus originated Trump went from praising China in January regarding their transparency in response to the Chinese outbreak to criticizing China in March for a lack of transparency to criticizing the World Health Organization in April for praising Chinas transparency

authored by Andrew Wakefield and published in The Lancet falsely claimed the vaccine was linked to colitis and autism spectrum disorders The paper was retracted in 2010 but is still cited by antivaccine activistsThe claims in the paper were widely reported leading to a sharp drop in vaccination rates in the UK and Ireland Promotion of the claimed link which continues in antivaccination propaganda despite being refuted has led to an increase in the incidence of measles and mumps resulting in deaths and serious permanent injuries Following the initial claims in 1998 multiple large epidemiological studies were undertaken Reviews of the evidence by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the American Academy of Pediatrics the Institute of Medicine of the US National Academy of Sciences the UK National Health Service and the Cochrane Library all found no link between the MMR vaccine and autism Physicians medical journals and editors have described Wakefields actions as fraudulent and tied them to epidemics and deathsAn investigation by journalist Brian Deer found that Wakefield the author of the original research paper linking the vaccine to autism had multiple undeclared conflicts of interest had manipulated evidence and had broken other ethical codes The Lancet paper was partially retracted in 2004 and fully retracted in 2010 when Lancets editorinchief Richard Horton described it as utterly false and said that the journal had been deceived Wakefield was found guilty by the General Medical Council of serious professional misconduct in

a signed editorial stated of the journalist It has taken the diligent scepticism of one man standing outside medicine and science to show that the paper was in fact an elaborate fraud The scientific

fundamental rights of autistic people According to estimates at the end of 2016 07 to 1 of the French population has an autism spectrum disorder most of which is undiagnosed leading to varying degrees of disabilityBefore the first intervention and medical definition initiatives autistic people  often likened to idiots or in the image of Victor of Aveyron wild children  were probably very marginalized and victims of serious violence The first steps were taken in the 1950s notably by Professor Roger Misès who set up day hospitals and devised the French classification of mental disorders in children and adolescents CFTMEA  classification française des troubles mentaux de lenfant et de ladolescent Interest in autism grew following the publication of Bruno Bettelheims The Empty Fortress 1967  and his lectures in France in the 1970s The first government measures in this area were taken in the 1990s by Simone Veil At the beginning of the 21st century the French psychiatric approach  which equated autism with a mental illness caused by poor parenting and advocated placement in a specialized institution  was challenged by parents associations who referred the matter to the Council of Europe because of the social exclusion it led to for autistic children and the blame placed on parents by the medical profession This led to autism being classified as a disability and to the introduction of new measures via four Autism Plans in the years 2000 and 2010 These led to creating an Autism Resource Centre in each region of France The old classification of autism as a psychosis is gradually being abandoned in favor of the concept of autism spectrum disorder ASD which is present in international classifications and takes account of the contribution of neuroscience and the development of individuals in society The Autism Plans recommend increasing school enrolment rates for children as well as employment for adults However in a report to be published in March 2019 the ONU is calling on France to embark on a genuine policy of deinstitutionalizationThe team at the CHRU in Tours was a pioneer in the study of autism thanks in particular to the work of Gilbert Lelord

children have spoken out in public debates or autobiographies including Olivia Cattan Danièle Langloys and Francis Perrin More recently autistic people such as Josef Schovanec have spoken out in support of neurodiversity in the face of the medical model Associations that have historically been active in this field include Autisme France Sésame Autisme and Association for research into autism and the prevention of maladjustment in France ARAPI  Association pour la recherche sur lautisme et la prévention des inadaptationsThe treatment of autism in France is a source of much tension particularly on the question of intervention which pits supporters of a behavioral approach represented by parents associations and certain cognitivist scientists against those who use a psychoanalytical frame of reference and the movement for the rights of autistic people Specifically French practices such as the frequent use of the word autistic as an insult and the overmedication with neuroleptics are a source of exclusion and suffering for the people concerned who are affected by numerous social difficulties such as dropping out of school and unemployment Recent research

autism', 'summary': 'The pathophysiology of autism is the study of the physiological processes that cause or are otherwise associated with autism spectrum disordersAutisms symptoms result from maturationrelated changes in various systems of the brain How autism occurs is not yet well understood Its mechanism can be divided into two areas the pathophysiology of brain structures and processes associated with autism and the neuropsychological linkages between brain structures and behaviors The behaviors appear to have multiple pathophysiologiesThere is evidence that gutbrain axis abnormalities may be involved A 2015 review proposed that immune gastrointestinal inflammation malfunction of the autonomic nervous system gut flora alterations and food metabolites may cause brain neuroinflammation and dysfunction A 2016 review concludes that enteric nervous system abnormalities might play a role in neurological disorders such as autism Neural connections and the immune system are a pathway that may allow diseases originated in the intestine spread to the brainSeveral lines of evidence point to synaptic dysfunction as a cause of autism Some rare mutations may lead to autism by disrupting some synaptic pathways such as those involved with cell adhesion All known teratogens agents that cause birth defects related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight weeks from conception and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later there is strong evidence that autism arises very early in developmentIn general neuroanatomical studies support the concept that autism may involve a combination of brain enlargement in some areas and reduction in others These studies suggest that autism may be caused by abnormal neuronal growth and pruning during the early stages of prenatal and postnatal brain development leaving some areas of the brain with too many neurons and other areas with too few neurons Some research has reported an overall brain enlargement in autism while others suggest abnormalities in several areas of the brain including the frontal lobe the mirror neuron system the limbic system the temporal lobe and the corpus callosumIn functional neuroimaging studies when performing theory of mind and facial emotion response tasks the median person on the autism spectrum exhibits less activation in the primary and secondary somatosensory cortices of the brain than the median member of a properly sampled control population This finding coincides with reports demonstrating abnormal patterns of cortical thickness and grey matter volume in those regions of autistic peoples brainsThe imbalance in excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission particularly involving neurotransmitters such as glutamate and gammaaminobutyric acid has also been proposed as a potential mechanism underlying the behavioral and cognitive manifestations observed in individuals with ASD', 'url':

the 19181920 Spanish flu pandemic and the second being the 1977 Russian flu The first identified human case was in La Gloria Mexico a rural town in Veracruz The virus appeared to be a new strain of H1N1 that resulted from a previous triple reassortment of bird swine and human flu viruses which further combined with a Eurasian pig flu virus leading to the term swine fluUnlike most strains of influenza the pandemic H1N109 virus did not disproportionately infect adults older than 60 years this was an unusual and characteristic feature of the H1N1 pandemic Even in the case of previously healthy people a small percentage develop pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS This manifests itself as increased breathing difficulty and typically occurs three to six days after initial onset of flu symptoms The pneumonia caused by flu can be either direct viral pneumonia or a secondary bacterial pneumonia A November 2009 New England Journal of Medicine article recommended that flu patients whose chest Xray indicates pneumonia receive both antivirals and antibiotics In particular it is a warning sign if a child seems to be getting better and then relapses with high fever as this relapse may be bacterial pneumoniaSome studies estimated that the real number of cases including asymptomatic and mild cases could be 700 million to 14 billion peopleor 11 to 21 percent of the global population of 68 billion at the time The lower value of 700 million is more than the 500 million people estimated to have been infected by the Spanish flu pandemic However the Spanish

Bhutan Atlantic and Northern Canada mainland China Hong Kong Macau Malaysia Montserrat New Zealand North Korea Northern Ireland Singapore Scotland South Korea Taiwan East Timor Thailand Tonga and

beneficial part of human neurodiversity The understanding of autism has been shaped by cultural scientific and societal factors and its perception and treatment change over time as scientific understanding of autism developsThe term autism was first introduced by Eugen Bleuler in his description of schizophrenia in 1911 The diagnosis of schizophrenia was broader than its modern equivalent autistic children were often diagnosed with childhood schizophrenia The earliest research that focused on children who would today be considered autistic was conducted by Grunya Sukhareva starting in the 1920s In the 1930s and 1940s Hans Asperger and Leo Kanner described two related syndromes later termed infantile autism and Asperger syndrome Kanner thought that the condition he had described might be distinct from schizophrenia and in the following decades research into what would become known as autism accelerated Formally however autistic children continued to be diagnosed under various terms related to schizophrenia in both the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM and International Classification of Diseases ICD but by the early 1970s it had become more widely recognized that autism and schizophrenia were in fact distinct mental disorders and in 1980 this was formalized for the first time with new diagnostic categories in the DSMIII Asperger syndrome was introduced to the DSM as a formal diagnosis in 1994 but in 2013 Asperger syndrome and infantile autism were reunified into a single diagnostic category autism spectrum disorder ASDAutistic individuals often struggle with understanding nonverbal social cues and emotional sharing The development of the web has given many autistic people a way to form online communities work remotely and attend school remotely which can directly benefit those experiencing communicating typically Societal and cultural aspects of autism have developed some in the community seek a cure while others believe that autism is simply another way of beingAlthough the rise of organizations and charities relating to advocacy for autistic people and their caregiver and efforts to destigmatize ASD have affected how ASD is viewed Autistic individuals and their caregivers continue to experience social stigma in situations where autistic peoples behaviour is thought of negatively and many primary care physicians and medical specialists express beliefs consistent with outdated autism researchThe discussion of autism has brought about much controversy Without researchers being able to meet a consensus on the varying forms of the condition there was for a time a lack of research being conducted on what is now classed as autism Discussing the syndrome and its complexity frustrated researchers Controversies

autism researcher This theory proposes that many of the difficulties autistic individuals face when socializing with nonautistic individuals are due in part to a lack of mutual understanding between the two groups meaning that most autistic people struggle to understand and empathize with nonautistic people whereas most nonautistic people also struggle to understand and empathize with autistic people This lack of understanding may stem from bidirectional differences in communication style socialcognitive characteristics and experiences between autistic and nonautistic individuals but not necessarily an inherent deficiency Recent studies have shown that most autistic individuals are able to socialize communicate effectively empathize well and display social reciprocity with most other autistic individuals This theory and subsequent findings challenge the commonly held belief that the social skills of autistic individuals are inherently impaired as well as the theory of mindblindness proposed by prominent autism researcher Simon BaronCohen in the mid1980s which suggested that empathy and theory of mind are universally impaired in autistic individualsThe double empathy concept has been consistently supported by a substantial number of studies in recent years and has the potential to radically shift goals of interventions and public psychoeducation regarding autism In recognition of recent findings that support the theory BaronCohen positively recognized the theory of the double empathy problem in two research articles in 2018 and 2022 as well as in

76 and 90 of them being unemployed in Europe in 2014 and ca 85 in the US in 2023 Similarly in the United Kingdom 78 of autistic adults are unemployed This is despite the fact that approximately 50 of people with autism spectrum disorder ASD have an IQ in the average to high range and do not have any additional physical needsWhat is striking about the claims that autistic people possess such talents for employment is the research that shows they have the lowest employment rates of all disability groups These findings show that young autistic adults are the most unemployed group when compared with their peers with learning disability intellectual disability and speechlanguage impairmentThe majority of people diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder want and are able to work and there are wellpublicized examples of successful careers Autistic people have long been kept in specialized institutions with the majority remaining dependent on their families Adults with autism are compulsorily underemployed and generally have access to lowskilled parttime discontinuous jobs in socalled protected environments without their wishes and aspirations being taken into account The most restricted prospects are for nonverbal people with behavioral disordersA wide variety of careers and positions are potentially accessible although positions requiring little human interaction are notoriously favored and associated with greater success Sectors such as intelligence and information processing in the military the hospitality and restaurant industry translation and copywriting IT art handicraft mechanics and nature agriculture and animal husbandry are particularly soughtafter and adaptedThe problems encountered in accessing and remaining in employment have several explanations Generally linked to poor communication between employers and autistic workers they stem above all from the difficulties encountered by autistic people in understanding social relationships and managing their sensory hypersensitivities and from employers intolerance of these particularities much more so than from intellectual disability Frequent discrimination on the job market closes the door to people with autism who are also often victims of unsuitable work organization A number of measures can be put in place to resolve these difficulties including job coaching and adapting working conditions in terms of sensoriality and working hours Some companies practice affirmative action particularly in the IT sector where highfunctioning people with autism are seen as a competitive

imprinting an epigenetic process through which genes are expressed differently by way of one parents contribution having more effect than the other Specifically proponents of the imprinted brain hypothesis propose that autism spectrum disorders are caused by paternal overimprinting while schizophrenia spectrum disorders are caused by maternal overimprinting they point to a number of supposed correlations and anticorrelations seen between the disorders and other traits to support the hypothesisWhile the hypothesis has found some attention in popular science it lacks scientific backing It has also been attacked as unfalsifiable exaggerated and overly broad Specific issues for the hypothesis include that the predictions it makes about genetic disorders are falsified that the effects of

passport is typically coordinated with policies enforced by individual businesses or enforceable public health orders that require patrons to present proof of vaccination for COVID19 as a condition of entry or serviceGovernmentmandated use of vaccine passports typically applies to discretionary public spaces and events such as indoor restaurants bars or largescale inperson events such as concerts

repetitive and inflexible patterns of behavior Autism generally affects a persons ability to understand and connect with others as well as their adaptability to everyday situations with its severity and support needs varying widely across the spectrum For example some are nonspeaking while others have very proficient spoken languageA formal diagnosis of ASD according to either the DSM5 or the World Health Organizations ICD11 criteria requires not merely the presence of ASD symptoms but symptoms that cause significant impairment in multiple domains of functioning in addition to being atypical or excessive for the individuals age and sociocultural contextCommon signs of ASD include difficulty with social interaction and verbal and nonverbal communication along with perseverative interests stereotypic body movements rigid routines and hyper or hyporeactivity to sensory inputThe DSM5 and ICD11 classify autism as a neurodevelopmental disorder but the autism rights movement and some researchers see autistic people as part of humanitys natural neurodiversity From this point of view autistic people may also be diagnosed with a disability of some sort but that disability may be rooted in the systemic structures of a society rather than in the person thus proponents argue that autistic people should be accommodated rather than cured On the contrary other scientists argue that many of the impairments associated with ASD are inherent to the disorderThe neurodiversity perspective has led to significant controversy among those who are autistic and advocates practitioners and charitiesThere are many theories about the causes of autism it is highly heritable and mainly genetic but many genes are involved and environmental factors may also be relevant The syndrome frequently cooccurs with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder epilepsy and intellectual disability and research indicates that autistic people have significantly higher rates of LGBTQ identities and feelings than the general population Disagreements persist about what should be included as part of the diagnosis whether there are meaningful subtypes or stages of autism and the significance of autismassociated traits in the wider population The combination of broader criteria increased awareness and the potential increase of actual prevalence has led to considerably increased estimates of autism prevalence since the 1990s The World Health Organization estimates about 1 in 100 children had autism between 2012 and 2021 as that was the average estimate in studies during that period with a trend of increasing prevalence over time This increasing prevalence has reinforced the myth perpetuated by antivaccine activists that autism is caused by vaccines Boys are also significantly far more frequently diagnosed than girlsThere is no cure for autism Advocates of autistic people argue that efforts to find a cure are misguided and even harmful Early intervention services based on applied

cough proper intake of fluids rest and nasal breathing Good personal hygiene and a healthy diet are also recommended As of April 2020 the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC recommended that those who suspect they are carrying the virus isolate themselves at home and wear a face mask As of November 2020 use of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone had been strongly recommended in those severe cases treated in hospital with low oxygen levels to reduce the risk of death Noninvasive ventilation and ultimately admission to an intensive care unit for mechanical ventilation may be required to support breathing Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ECMO has been used to address  respiratory failure but its benefits are still under consideration Some of the cases of severe disease course are caused by systemic hyperinflammation the socalled cytokine stormAlthough several medications have been approved in different countries as of April 2022 not all countries have these medications Patients with mild to moderate symptoms who are in the risk groups can take nirmatrelvirritonavir marketed as Paxlovid or remdesivir either of which reduces the risk of serious illness or

cheap and widely available antidepressant As of December 2020 there was not enough highquality evidence to recommend socalled early treatment In December 2020 two monoclonal antibodybased therapies were available in the United States for early use in cases thought to be at high risk of progression to severe disease The antiviral remdesivir has been available in the US Canada Australia and several other countries with varying restrictions however it is not recommended for people needing mechanical ventilation and has been discouraged altogether by the World Health Organization WHO due to limited evidence of its efficacy In November 2021 the UK approved the use of molnupiravir as a COVID treatment for vulnerable patients recently diagnosed with the diseaseThe WHO the Chinese National Health Commission the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and the United States National Institutes of Health among other bodies and agencies worldwide have all published

of the Sabah state election in September 2020 and several outbreaks at Top Glove facilities in late 2020 The Malaysian government responded by restoring CMCO restrictions in most states since November 2020 to counter the outbreak By midJanuary 2021 the pressure of COVID19 on the countrys healthcare system led to the reintroduction of MCO restrictions across various Malaysian states and federal territories which was extended to March 4 2021 A nationwide state of emergency was also declared on 12 January 2021 by the Yang diPertuan Agong suspending Parliament and State Legislative assemblies and granting the Muhyiddin government emergency powers until 1 August 2021Due to a decline in new cases by early March 2021 the government lifted MCO restrictions in all states and federal territories However the restrictions were reinstated in several states in midApril as infection cases rose again With novel SARSCoV2 variants detected in Malaysia and a record surge in daily COVID19 cases and deaths the government reintroduced a nationwide MCO once more from May 12 2021 The MCO was strengthened into a total lockdown from June 1 that was extended indefinitely as the severe and continued spread of the Delta variant led to Malaysias healthcare system capacity being reached in some regionsFollowing high vaccination rates in the adult population against COVID19 and a decrease in the number of severe cases of the disease since September 2021 Malaysia announced its intention to transition to treating COVID19 as an endemic disease by the end of October 2021 with more generalised restrictions being eased A fifth wave fueled by the Omicron variant led to record daily cases in February and March 2022 but was marked by lower numbers of hospitalizations and deaths than during the spread of the Delta variant As of March 2022 the BA2 Omicron subvariant was projected to be the dominant strain in the countryThe pandemic has had a severe economic impact devaluing Malaysias currency and shrinking its GDP and has had farreaching effects on Malaysian society The onset of the pandemic in early 2020 coincided with an initially unrelated political crisis that hampered the governments early response and the repeated COVID19 waves and emergency measures exacerbated ongoing political instability throughout 2020 and 2021 This led to Muhyiddins resignation following the collapse of his

accelerated deforestation of the Amazon rainforest and increased poaching in parts of Africa The hindrance of environmental policy efforts combined with economic slowdown may have contributed to slowed investment in green energy technologies The pandemic also led to increased medical waste Production and use of medical equipment such as personal protective equipment contributed to plastic

from another animal species Species that are thought to be important in the emergence of new human strains are pigs chickens and ducks These novel strains are unaffected by any immunity people may have to older strains of human influenza and can therefore spread extremely rapidly and infect very large numbers of people Influenza A viruses can occasionally be transmitted from wild birds to other species causing outbreaks in domestic poultry and may give rise to human influenza pandemics The propagation of influenza viruses throughout the world is thought to be in part by bird migrations though commercial shipments of live bird products might also be implicated as well as human travel patternsThe World Health Organization WHO has produced a sixstage classification that describes the process by which a novel influenza virus moves from the first few infections in humans through to a pandemic This starts with the virus mostly infecting animals with a few cases where animals infect people then moves through the stage where the virus begins to spread directly between people and ends with a pandemic when infections from the new virus have spread worldwideOne strain of virus that

immune cells which use the designed mRNA as a blueprint to build foreign protein that would normally be produced by a pathogen such as a virus or by a cancer cell These protein molecules stimulate an adaptive immune response that teaches the body to identify and destroy the corresponding pathogen or cancer cells The mRNA is delivered by a coformulation of the RNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles that protect the RNA strands and help their absorption into the cellsReactogenicity the tendency of a vaccine to produce adverse reactions is similar to that of conventional nonRNA vaccines People susceptible to an autoimmune response may have an adverse reaction to messenger RNA vaccines The advantages of mRNA vaccines over traditional vaccines are ease of design speed and lower cost of production the induction of both cellular and humoral immunity and lack of interaction with the genomic DNA While some messenger RNA vaccines such as the PfizerBioNTech COVID19 vaccine

10231343 are confirmed cases including 18775 deathsThe virus was confirmed to have spread to Taiwan on 21 January 2020 with the first case being a 50yearold woman who had been teaching in Wuhan China The Taiwanese government integrated data from the national health care system immigration and customs authorities to aid in the identification and response to the virus Government efforts are coordinated through the National Health Command Center NHCC of the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control established to aid in disaster management for epidemics following the 2003 SARS outbreak The Journal of the American Medical Association says Taiwan engaged in 124 discrete action items to prevent the spread of the disease including early screening of flights from Mainland China and the tracking of individual casesStarting 19 March 2020 foreign nationals were barred from entering Taiwan with some exceptions such as those carrying out the remainder of business contracts and those holding valid Alien Resident Certificates diplomatic credentials or other official documentation and special permits Restrictions have since been relaxed for foreign university students and those seeking medical treatment in Taiwan subject to prior government approval All who are admitted into the country must complete a fourteenday quarantine upon arrival except for business travelers from countries determined to be at low or moderate risk who are subject to five or sevenday quarantines and must submit to a COVID19 testIn response to the worldwide spike in cases in October and November 2020 Taiwan announced that all travelers to and transiting through Taiwan regardless of nationality origin or purpose must submit a negative COVID19 test performed within three working days of arrival Exceptions are granted to travelers responding to family emergencies or arriving from countries where ondemand or selfpaid tests are unavailable but they are required to be seated apart from other passengers and take a selfpaid test immediately on arrival in Taiwan In 2020 the pandemic had a smaller impact in Taiwan than in most other industrialized countries with a total of seven deaths The number of active cases in this first wave peaked on 6 April 2020 at 307 cases the overwhelming majority of which were imported Taiwans handling of the outbreak has received international praise for its effectiveness in quarantining peopleHowever an outbreak among Taiwanese crew members of the stateowned China Airlines in late April 2021 led to a sharp surge in cases mainly in the Greater Taipei area from mid May In response the closure of all schools in the area from kindergarten to high schools was mandated for two weeks and national borders were closed for at least a month to those without a residence permit among other measures In addition to a low testing rate and the recent shortening of the quarantine period for pilots to just three days Taiwanese medical experts said that they had expected the flareup due to the emergence of more transmissible variants of the coronavirus the Alpha variant was found in many of those linked to the China Airlines cluster combined with the slow progress of Taiwans vaccination campaign Critics linked the latter issue to several factors including Taiwans strategy of focusing on its own vaccine development and production making it less ready to quickly buy overseas vaccines once those became available and hesitation among residents to get vaccinated due to previously low case numbers Additionally heavy reporting on rare side effects of the AstraZeneca vaccine was believed to have played a role Demand for vaccines greatly increased however with the surge in cases from May 2021', 'url':

one of its surface proteins The agent stimulates the bodys immune system to recognize the agent as a threat destroy it and recognize further and destroy any of the microorganisms associated with that agent that it may encounter in the futureVaccines can be  prophylactic to prevent or alleviate the effects of a future infection by a natural or wild pathogen or therapeutic to fight a disease that has already occurred such as cancer Some vaccines offer full sterilizing immunity in which infection is preventedThe administration of vaccines is called vaccination Vaccination is the most effective method of preventing infectious diseases widespread immunity due to vaccination is largely responsible for the worldwide eradication of smallpox and the restriction of diseases such as polio measles and tetanus from much of the world The World Health Organization WHO reports that licensed vaccines are currently available for twentyfive different preventable infectionsThe first recorded use of inoculation to prevent smallpox occurred in the 16th century in China with the earliest hints of the practice in China coming during the 10th century It was also the first disease for which a vaccine was produced The folk practice of inoculation against smallpox was brought from Turkey to Britain in 1721 by Lady Mary Wortley MontaguThe terms vaccine and vaccination are derived from Variolae vaccinae smallpox of the cow the term devised by Edward Jenner who both developed the concept of vaccines and created the first vaccine to denote cowpox He used the phrase in 1798 for the long title of his Inquiry into the Variolae vaccinae Known as the Cow Pox in which he described the protective effect of cowpox against smallpox In 1881 to honor Jenner Louis Pasteur proposed that the terms should be extended to cover the new protective inoculations then being developed The science of vaccine development and production is termed vaccinology', 'url':
