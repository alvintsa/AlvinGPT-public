/Users/alvintsang/miniconda3/lib/python3.10/site-packages/wikipedia/wikipedia.py:389: GuessedAtParserWarning: No parser was explicitly specified, so I'm using the best available HTML parser for this system ("lxml"). This usually isn't a problem, but if you run this code on another system, or in a different virtual environment, it may use a different parser and behave differently.

The code that caused this warning is on line 389 of the file /Users/alvintsang/miniconda3/lib/python3.10/site-packages/wikipedia/wikipedia.py. To get rid of this warning, pass the additional argument 'features="lxml"' to the BeautifulSoup constructor.

  lis = BeautifulSoup(html).find_all('li')
