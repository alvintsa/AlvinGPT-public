formalized activities did not fully emerge for either women or men until the late industrial age Cahn 1994 This shift marked a significant change in how sports were structured and practiced eventually leading to more inclusive opportunities for female participation Eitzen 2009 Until roughly 1870 women s activities tended to be informal and recreational in nature lacked rules codes and emphasized physical activity rather than competition Today women s sports are more sport specific and have developed into both amateur levels and professional levels in various places internationally but is found primarily within developed countries where conscious organization and accumulation of wealth has occurred In the mid to latter part of the 20th century female participation in sport and the popularization of their involvement increased particularly during its last quarter Very few organized sports have been invented by women Sports such as Newcomb ball netball acrobatic gymnastics and tumbling and possibly stoolball are examples Women s involvement in sports is more visible in well developed countries and today their level of participation and performance still varies greatly by country and by sport Despite an increase in women s participation in sport the male demographic is still the larger of the two These demographic differences are observed globally Female dominated sports are the one exception Girls participation in sports tend to be higher in the United States than in other parts of the world like Western Europe and Latin America Girls participation in more violent contact sports is far less than that of their male counterparts Two important divisions exist in relation to female sporting categories These sports either emerged exclusively as an organized female sport with male exclusion or were developed as an organized female variant of a sport first popularized by a male demographic and therefore became a female category In all but a few exceptional cases such as in the case of camogie a female variant or women s game uses the same name of the sport popularly played by men but is classified into a different category which is differentiated by sex men s or women s or girls or boys Female variants are widely common while organized female sports by comparison are rare and include team sports such as netball throwball artistic n e synchronized swimming and ringette In female sports the supposed benefits of gender parity gender equity and sex segregation are controversial Except in a few rare cases like women s professional tennis professional women s sport rarely provide competitors with a livable income In addition competing for media coverage of the women s variant of a sport which is primarily popular among males creates complex barriers More recently there has been an increasing amount of interest research investment and production in regards to equipment design for female athletes Interest and research involving the identification of sex specific injuries particularly though not exclusively among high performance female athletes has increased as well such as in the case of concussions and the female athlete triad a k a Relative energy deficiency in sport RED S At times female athletes have engaged in social activism in conjunction with their participation in sport Protest methods have included playing strikes social media campaigns and in the case of America federal lawsuits on grounds of inequality usually as it relates to gender parity principles American law and Title IX which demand schools that any funds given to support students sports should be equally distributed between boys and girls Public service oriented promotional campaigns for girls in sport involve a variety of media campaign styles

hexapod invertebrates of the class Insecta They are the largest group within the arthropod phylum Insects have a chitinous exoskeleton a three part body head thorax and abdomen three pairs of jointed legs compound eyes and a pair of antennae Insects are the most diverse group of animals with more than a million described species they represent more than half of all animal species The insect nervous system consists of a brain and a ventral nerve cord Most insects reproduce by laying eggs Insects breathe air through a system of paired openings along their sides connected to small tubes that take air directly to the tissues The blood therefore does not carry oxygen it is only partly contained in vessels and some circulates in an open hemocoel Insect vision is mainly through their compound eyes with additional small ocelli Many insects can hear using tympanal organs which may be on the legs or other parts of the body Their sense of smell is via receptors usually on the antennae and the mouthparts Nearly all insects hatch from eggs Insect growth is constrained by the inelastic exoskeleton so development involves a series of molts The immature stages often differ from the adults in structure habit and habitat Groups that undergo four stage metamorphosis often have a nearly immobile pupa Insects that undergo three stage metamorphosis lack a pupa developing through a series of increasingly adult like nymphal stages The higher level relationship of the insects is unclear Fossilized insects of enormous size have been found from the Paleozoic Era including giant dragonfly like insects with wingspans of 55 to 70 cm 22 to 28 in The most diverse insect groups appear to have coevolved with flowering plants Adult insects typically move about by walking and flying some can swim Insects are the only invertebrates that can achieve sustained powered flight insect flight evolved just once Many insects are at least partly aquatic and have larvae with gills in some species the adults too are aquatic Some species such as water striders can walk on the surface of water Insects are mostly solitary but some such as bees ants and termites are social and live in large well organized colonies Others such as earwigs provide maternal care guarding their eggs and young Insects can communicate with each other in a variety of ways Male moths can sense the pheromones of female moths over great distances Other species communicate with sounds crickets stridulate or rub their wings together to attract a mate and repel other males Lampyrid beetles communicate with light Humans regard many insects as pests especially those that damage crops and attempt to control them using insecticides and other techniques Others are parasitic and may act as vectors of diseases Insect pollinators are essential to the reproduction of many flowering plants and so to their ecosystems Many insects are ecologically beneficial as predators of pest insects while a few provide direct economic benefit Two species in particular are economically important and were domesticated many centuries ago silkworms for silk and honey bees for honey Insects are consumed as food in 80 of the world s nations by people in roughly 3 000 ethnic groups Human activities are having serious effects on insect biodiversity ", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect"]}}
